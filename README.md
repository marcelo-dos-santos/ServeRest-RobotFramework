# ServeRest-RobotFramework
This repository contains a collection of automated tests for the ServeRest API using the Robot Framework. The tests cover a range of scenarios, including user authentication, cart management, and product listing. By automating these tests, we can ensure that the API functions as expected and identify any issues early on in the development process.
